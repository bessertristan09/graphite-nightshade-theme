## 🧩 How to Install the Figtree Font Locally (Windows)

If your browser doesn’t render the Figtree font properly (especially after refreshing pages), installing the font locally can help ensure a consistent look across your system.

### 🔽 1. Download the Figtree Font

1. Visit the official Google Fonts page:  
   👉 [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree)

2. Click the **"Get font"** button in the top-right corner.

3. Click the **"Download all"** button on the right

4. This will download a `.zip` file (e.g. `Figtree.zip`) containing all Figtree font files.

### 📂 2. Extract the ZIP Archive

1. Right-click the downloaded `Figtree.zip` file.
2. Choose **“Extract all…”**.
3. Select a destination folder (e.g. Desktop or Downloads) and extract the files.

### 🧷 3. Install the Font

1. Open the extracted folder (e.g. `Figtree`).
2. Select all `.ttf` files (`Ctrl + A`).
3. Right-click on the selection and choose:
   - **“Install”** *(for current user)*  
   or  
   - **“Install for all users”** *(requires admin permissions)*

> 💡 Alternatively, double-click a font file to preview it, then click the **Install** button in the preview window.

### ✅ 4. Done!

The Figtree font is now installed on your computer and will be available system-wide – including as a fallback in browsers if the web font fails to load.

**Note:** This step is usually not required for most users, but it may help in edge cases where Chrome or Firefox does not load the web font properly outside a dashboard context.
